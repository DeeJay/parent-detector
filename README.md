A Raspberry Pi Parent Detector
===============

How to use a Raspberry Pi to detect who's been in your room

![image](./images/cover.jpg "Cover Image")

A Raspberry Pi is so small that it can easily be hidden or concealed and that makes it the perfect tool for this kind of project.  The basic idea here is that weâ€™re going to use motion detection to trigger video recording via the Raspberry Pi Camera Board.  You can then leave the Pi hidden in your room and see who's been caught on camera when you get home from School.

##Lesson objective
* Understand a Passive Infra Red motion sesnor
* Understand how to use the `picamera` Python module
* Understand how to record videos
* Understand how to play back videos

##Lesson outcome
*	To have built and tested a Raspberry Pi parent detector
*	Caught someone on camera
*	Gained experience in Python programming
*	Gained experience using the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins

##Time
*	1-2 hours
