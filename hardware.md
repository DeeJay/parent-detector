## Hardware
As well as a Raspberry Pi with an SD card loaded with Raspbian, you'll also need:

- [Raspberry Pi Camera Module](http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module/)
- PIR motion sensor module (try [eBay](http://search.ebay.co.uk/pir+motion+sensor+module))
- Female-to-female jumper wires, at least 3 (try [eBay](http://search.ebay.co.uk/female+to+female+jumper+wires+solderless))
