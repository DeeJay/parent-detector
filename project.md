# What you will make:

A Raspberry Pi is so small that it can easily be hidden; that makes it the perfect tool for a hideen device that detects when unwanted visitors to your bedroom (like parents) are around.

In this tutorial you will make a parent detector that use motion detection to trigger video recording via the Raspberry Pi Camera Board. You can then leave the Pi hidden in your room and see who's been caught on camera when you get home from school.
