# What you will make:

How to use a Raspberry Pi to detect who's been in your room. A Raspberry Pi is so small that it can easily be hidden; that makes it the perfect tool for a hidden device that detects unwanted visitors to your bedroom (like parents).

In this tutorial you will make a parent detector that use motion detection to trigger video recording via the Raspberry Pi Camera Board. You can then leave the Pi hidden in your room and see who's been caught on camera when you get home from school.
